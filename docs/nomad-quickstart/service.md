# Deploy as a Service

Using [the example service job definition](https://github.com/stut/aleff/blob/develop/aleff-service-job.hcl) (embedded below) as a starting point, make the changes required to match your target cluster.

Don't forget to change both the main job and the `aleff-challenge-responder` job, which is embedded as a template.
